# Live Lift Capacity Display (scaled-down prototype)

Built using an arduino uno and IR sensors. Implemented with python (flask), html, and css.

### Summary of Implementation

1. IR sensors are used to detect the presence of a person in the lift.
2. IR sensor data are stored according to their position and written to a file with the arduino uno.
3. The python program reads the latest data in the file and generates a display based on the read data.
4. The display on the webapp is update.
